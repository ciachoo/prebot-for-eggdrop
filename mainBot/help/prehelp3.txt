  This is used to replay pre release information or their NFO/JPG data. The
  optional --files switch is used to return NFO and JPG data whereas not using
  --files will return pre release detail.

  !preplay --day [--files] <YYYY-MM-DD>

  !preplay --between [--files] <rls1> <rls2>

  !preplay [--files] <query> [offset]
    The search query is an exact query however wild cards may be used. The offset is
    used to start matches results at the defined offset, useful for resuming a replay.
