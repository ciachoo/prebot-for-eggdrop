Switches:
 Search is case insensitive by default
 Allowed wildcards are *, %, and white space. For single character wildcard a ? may be used.
 
 These are accepted by all the commands listed below:
   -C (Case sensitive) -b (Blocked) -B (Bare) -i (NFO Only)
   -j (JPG Only) -I (No NFO Only) -J (No JPG Only) -n (no nukes) -N (only nukes)
   -c (no crap releases) -h (hide extra data) -l (only english results) -o (opposite sort)
   -w (exact mode) -S <start at> -E <end at> -e <exclusion> -r <results> 
   -s [!]<section> -t <days back> -g <genre> -G <group> -R <regexp filter> release
   
   The following triggers require no paramters:
   -C -b -B -i -j -I -J -c -n -N -l -o -h and -w
     However, if you type -N:reason it searches the nuke reasons for reason.
   
   Anything in <> is required paramater after the switch.
   
   -e excludes words from results, ex: !pre -e star|wars episode
     Results with the word episode and without star or wars will be shown.
   -r will notice you the number of results you supply, you must supply it, maximum of 50.
   -S will make the results start at the number you specifiy rather than 1.
   -E will make the results end at the number you specifiy rather than after 4, maxiumum 10.
   -R allows users to match a release based on a regexp filter.
     Ex. !pre -b -R [e3][-()_.e3]*f[-()_.f]*n[-()_.n]*[e3][-()_.e3]*[7t] *
